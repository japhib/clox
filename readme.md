Format everything:

`clang-format --style=file -i *.h *.c`

Other stuff I want to implement:

- Test suite - maybe also unit test framework in the language?
- List data type
- Errors with try/catch
- Coroutines
- File I/O standard library
- String manipulation/regex standard library

- C API for foreign functions
- VSCode extension
